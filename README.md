# Navigating Ship Valuations: A Comprehensive Analysis of Market Drivers

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description:

The current study considers bulk carriers within the shipping industry and focuses on the case of the Bet Performer. This paper employs some statistical techniques and economic theories to value the effects that the fundamental factors-a vessel's age, DWT, market indices, and condition-have on the selling price. We develop a data-driven approach to approximating ship valuations by analyzing historic sales data, track dependencies, and conduct an analysis of the market trends flow as per the Baltic Dry Index.

These findings underline that the most relevant factors in price predictions using linear regression modeling are DWT, age, and market indices. Examples include the very strong positive relationship of cargo capacity with value and the negative influence of age. Other interpretations concern the effects of global market activity, operating efficiency, and regulatory compliance on pricing decisions.

This is followed by a suggested valuation approach for the Bet Performer, based on market volatility, depreciation, and other resale options that will be available, including scrap value. The given project has provided ample practical experience for stakeholders concerned with the valuation of maritime assets and making investment decisions that effectively integrate quantitative rigor with specialized industry knowledge.
